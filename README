this repository contains some test scripts for osm data.

This repository relies on my other repository python-osm
(https://github.com/werner2101/python-osm) which provices generic
tools for osm data.

Test scripts in this repository:

watershed analyses
=================

Analyses the waterways and waterway relations (type=waterway) and builds
connection data, watershed trees, ...


relation type analyses and statistics
=====================================

Analyses the usage of relation types. See http://www.h-renrew.de/h/osm/osmchecks/02_Relationstypen/index.html for the results.
